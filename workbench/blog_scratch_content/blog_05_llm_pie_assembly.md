If you've been following this series, you'll know that back in Blog 2, we got a basic LLM running on the ESP32-S3. That was exciting - we had the Stories260K model generating children's stories at 25-30 tokens per second using ESP-DSP's float SIMD operations. It worked. It was cool. But it wasn't *production ready*.

This post is about what changed to make it production ready. And fair warning: this is the flagship post of the series. We're going deep into inline assembly, quantization theory, and training pipelines. Grab coffee.

**Disclosure:** I relied heavily on Claude Code throughout this project. I won't pretend I wrote perfect PIE assembly from scratch - Claude helped me understand the instruction set, debug register issues, and optimize the loop structure. But I verified every line, tested it on hardware, and now I understand it well enough to explain it to you.

{{< sub-section title="What Changed Since Blog 2" icon="fa-refresh" >}}

In Blog 2, we had:
- Float32 inference using `dsps_dotprod_f32_aes3()` from ESP-DSP
- Dual-core parallelization with FreeRTOS
- Stories260K and Stories15M models
- ~25-30 tok/s for tiny models, ~0.5 tok/s for larger ones

Now we have:
- Int8 quantized weights (Q8_0 format)
- Custom PIE vector assembly for int8 dot products
- Fine-tuned model on 2,008 Q&A pairs about a person
- Three-phase training pipeline
- SAM robotic text-to-speech output

The performance improvement? About 2-3x faster inference. But more importantly, we can now fit a 6MB model in PSRAM and have it *actually do something useful* - answer questions about a specific person with genuine factual accuracy.

The key insight: ESP-DSP's SIMD is great for float operations, but the ESP32-S3 has a dedicated PIE (Processor Instruction Extension) vector unit with native int8 operations. If you're using int8 weights, you're leaving massive performance on the table by not using PIE.

{{< sub-section title="Q8_0 Quantization Deep Dive" icon="fa-compress" >}}

Before we dive into assembly, let's understand what Q8_0 quantization actually is. If you're familiar with LLM quantization, feel free to skip ahead. If not, this is crucial context.

**The Problem:** Float32 weights are 4 bytes each. A 6M parameter model needs 24MB just for weights. The ESP32-S3 has 8MB of PSRAM. See the issue?

**The Solution:** Store weights as 8-bit integers with a floating-point scale factor per group of elements.

Here's how Q8_0 works:

1. **Group Size**: We process weights in groups of 64 elements (configurable, but 64 works well)
2. **Find Scale**: For each group, find the maximum absolute value
3. **Compute Scale Factor**: `scale = max_abs / 127.0`
4. **Quantize**: `q[i] = round(x[i] / scale)` - each float becomes an int8
5. **Store**: Save the 64 int8 values plus one float32 scale factor

The math is beautiful in its simplicity:
```
Original: [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ...] (64 floats = 256 bytes)
Quantized: [63, -38, 101, ...] + scale=0.00787 (64 bytes + 4 bytes = 68 bytes)
```

That's 3.8x compression right there. And the best part? During inference, we can do integer dot products (fast!) and only multiply by the scale factors at the end (one multiply per group, not per element).

Here's the quantization function from `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/ml/llm_core.cpp`:

```cpp
void quantize(QuantizedTensor *qx, float* x, int n) {
    int num_groups = n / GS;
    float Q_MAX = 127.0f;

    for (int group = 0; group < num_groups; group++) {
        float* gx = x + group * GS;
        int8_t* gq = qx->q + group * GS;

        // Find max absolute value using unrolled loop
        float wmax = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < GS; i += 4) {
            float v0 = fabsf(gx[i]);
            float v1 = fabsf(gx[i+1]);
            float v2 = fabsf(gx[i+2]);
            float v3 = fabsf(gx[i+3]);
            if (v0 > wmax) wmax = v0;
            if (v1 > wmax) wmax = v1;
            if (v2 > wmax) wmax = v2;
            if (v3 > wmax) wmax = v3;
        }

        float scale = wmax / Q_MAX;
        qx->s[group] = scale;

        // Quantize with reciprocal multiply (faster than division)
        float inv_scale = (scale > 1e-10f) ? Q_MAX / wmax : 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < GS; i += 4) {
            gq[i]   = (int8_t)(gx[i]   * inv_scale + 0.5f - (gx[i]   < 0));
            gq[i+1] = (int8_t)(gx[i+1] * inv_scale + 0.5f - (gx[i+1] < 0));
            gq[i+2] = (int8_t)(gx[i+2] * inv_scale + 0.5f - (gx[i+2] < 0));
            gq[i+3] = (int8_t)(gx[i+3] * inv_scale + 0.5f - (gx[i+3] < 0));
        }
    }
}
```

Notice the loop unrolling - we process 4 elements at a time. This isn't for SIMD (we're using scalar float ops here), it's for instruction pipelining. The CPU can overlap the fabsf() calls and comparisons when we unroll like this.

The `+ 0.5f - (gx[i] < 0)` trick is rounding to nearest: add 0.5 for positive numbers, subtract 0.5 for negative (by subtracting 1 when negative). Clean and branchless.

**Quantization Error**: During export, we track the maximum quantization error per layer. For our 6M model, the worst-case error was about 0.002 - essentially imperceptible after the softmax in attention.

{{< /sub-section >}}

{{< sub-section title="PIE Vector Unit Assembly - The Main Event" icon="fa-microchip" >}}

Okay, here's where it gets fun. And by fun, I mean "I spent three days debugging register allocation issues."

The ESP32-S3 has a PIE (Processor Instruction Extension) vector unit. This is NOT the same as the AES3 instructions that ESP-DSP uses for float SIMD. PIE is a separate coprocessor with dedicated instructions for int8/int16 vector operations.

Let me break down what we have to work with:

**PIE Registers:**
- `q0-q7`: 128-bit vector registers. Each can hold 16 x int8, 8 x int16, or 4 x int32
- `accx`: 40-bit accumulator. This is crucial - it prevents overflow during long accumulations

**Key Instructions We Use:**
- `ee.vld.128.ip q0, %[ptr], 16`: Load 128 bits (16 bytes) from memory, auto-increment pointer by 16
- `ee.vmulas.s8.accx q0, q1`: Multiply 16 signed int8 pairs and accumulate sum to accx
- `wur.accx_0 %[val]` / `wur.accx_1 %[val]`: Write to low/high parts of accumulator
- `rur.accx_0 %[result]`: Read low 32 bits of accumulator
- `loopnez %[count], label`: Hardware zero-overhead loop

**Why 40-bit Accumulator?**

Here's the thing that wasn't obvious to me at first. When you multiply two int8 values, the result can be up to 127 * 127 = 16,129 (or -128 * 127 = -16,256 for signed). That fits in 16 bits.

But `ee.vmulas.s8.accx` does 16 of these multiplications and sums them ALL into the accumulator. That's up to 16 * 16,129 = 258,064 per instruction. And we're looping!

For a group size of 64 elements processed in chunks of 16, we do 4 iterations. Worst case accumulation: 4 * 258,064 = 1,032,256. That DOES fit in 32 bits (max ~2.1 billion). But if our vectors were longer, we'd overflow.

The 40-bit accumulator gives us headroom for vectors up to about 65,536 elements before we need to worry about overflow. Plenty for our use case.

Here's the star of the show - the inline assembly dot product:

```cpp
static inline int32_t dotprod_s8_simd(const int8_t* a, const int8_t* b, int len) {
    int32_t result;
    int chunks = len >> 4;  // len / 16

    asm volatile(
        // Clear 40-bit accumulator
        "wur.accx_0 %[zero]\n"        // Write 0 to low 32 bits
        "wur.accx_1 %[zero]\n"        // Write 0 to high 8 bits

        // Hardware loop: zero overhead, processes 16 int8 pairs per iteration
        "loopnez %[chunks], 1f\n"

        "ee.vld.128.ip q0, %[a], 16\n"    // Load 16 bytes from a[], a += 16
        "ee.vld.128.ip q1, %[b], 16\n"    // Load 16 bytes from b[], b += 16
        "ee.vmulas.s8.accx q0, q1\n"      // accx += sum(q0[i] * q1[i]) for i=0..15

        "1:\n"
        // Read low 32 bits of accumulator (result fits in 32 bits for our group sizes)
        "rur.accx_0 %[result]\n"

        : [result] "=r" (result), [a] "+r" (a), [b] "+r" (b)
        : [chunks] "r" (chunks), [zero] "r" (0)
        : "memory"
    );

    return result;
}
```

Let me walk through this line by line because this is THE critical path of our entire LLM inference.

**Line 1-2: Clear Accumulator**
```asm
"wur.accx_0 %[zero]\n"
"wur.accx_1 %[zero]\n"
```
Before we start accumulating, we zero out the 40-bit accumulator. `accx_0` is the lower 32 bits, `accx_1` is the upper 8 bits. We write `%[zero]` which is mapped to the C variable containing 0.

**Line 3: Hardware Loop**
```asm
"loopnez %[chunks], 1f\n"
```
This is the magic. `loopnez` sets up a hardware loop that runs `%[chunks]` times, jumping back from label `1:` with ZERO overhead. No branch prediction, no pipeline stalls, no loop counter decrement. The loop counter is handled entirely in hardware.

For a 64-element vector, chunks = 64/16 = 4, so we loop 4 times.

**Line 4-5: Load Vectors**
```asm
"ee.vld.128.ip q0, %[a], 16\n"
"ee.vld.128.ip q1, %[b], 16\n"
```
Load 128 bits (16 bytes = 16 int8 values) from pointer a into vector register q0, then auto-increment a by 16. Same for b into q1.

The `.ip` suffix means "immediate post-increment". The pointer updates happen automatically, so we don't need separate add instructions.

**Line 6: Multiply-Accumulate**
```asm
"ee.vmulas.s8.accx q0, q1\n"
```
This is where the magic happens. This single instruction:
1. Multiplies all 16 int8 pairs: q0[0]*q1[0], q0[1]*q1[1], ..., q0[15]*q1[15]
2. Sums all 16 products
3. Adds the sum to the 40-bit accumulator

16 multiply-accumulate operations in ONE CYCLE. That's the power of SIMD.

**Line 7: Loop End Label**
```asm
"1:\n"
```
This is where `loopnez` jumps back to until the count reaches zero.

**Line 8: Extract Result**
```asm
"rur.accx_0 %[result]\n"
```
Read the lower 32 bits of the accumulator into our result variable. For our group sizes, the result always fits in 32 bits.

**The Constraint Block:**
```cpp
: [result] "=r" (result), [a] "+r" (a), [b] "+r" (b)
: [chunks] "r" (chunks), [zero] "r" (0)
: "memory"
```
This tells the compiler:
- `result` is an output-only register (`=r`)
- `a` and `b` are both input and output (they get modified by the load-increment) (`+r`)
- `chunks` and `zero` are input-only registers (`r`)
- `"memory"` tells the compiler we're reading memory, so don't reorder around this

{{< sub-section title="Using PIE in Matrix Multiplication" icon="fa-th" >}}

The dot product is nice, but matrix multiplication is where we spend most of our time. Every attention layer, every FFN layer, every projection - it's all matmuls.

Here's how we use our PIE dot product in the quantized matrix multiplication:

```cpp
void matmul_q8(float* xout, QuantizedTensor* x, QuantizedTensor* w, int n, int d) {
    for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
        float val = 0.0f;
        int in = i * n;

        // Process each quantization group with SIMD
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - GS; j += GS) {
            // SIMD dot product for this group (GS elements)
            int32_t ival = dotprod_s8_simd(x->q + j, w->q + in + j, GS);

            // Scale by quantization scales (float32)
            val += (float)ival * w->s[(in + j) / GS] * x->s[j / GS];
        }
        xout[i] = val;
    }
}
```

The structure is:
1. For each output dimension (d rows)
2. For each quantization group (GS elements at a time)
3. Do integer dot product with SIMD
4. Multiply by the two scale factors (one from weights, one from activations)
5. Accumulate to float output

The key insight: we only do 2 float multiplies per group (one multiply to combine scales, one to accumulate). The expensive dot product with 64 multiply-adds happens in integer SIMD land.

For a typical layer with n=224, d=224:
- 224 * 224 = 50,176 total output elements per matmul
- Each needs 224/64 = 3.5 (rounded to 4) groups
- 4 SIMD dot products per output element
- 50,176 * 4 = 200,704 SIMD operations
- Each SIMD op processes 64/16 = 4 loop iterations
- Each iteration does 16 MACs

That's 200,704 * 4 * 16 = 12.8 million multiply-accumulates per matmul. And our model has MANY matmuls per token.

**Memory Alignment**: Notice in the allocation code we use `heap_caps_aligned_alloc(16, ...)` for the quantized buffers. PIE's vector loads require 16-byte alignment or you get undefined behavior (usually a crash with a cryptic backtrace).

{{< /sub-section >}}

{{< sub-section title="Other SIMD Optimizations" icon="fa-bolt" >}}

PIE assembly handles our int8 matmuls, but we still have float operations throughout the model. For those, we use ESP-DSP's AES3 SIMD instructions.

**RMSNorm with SIMD:**
```cpp
void rmsnorm(float* o, float* x, float* weight, int size) {
    // Sum of squares using SIMD dot product
    float ss = 0.0f;
    dsps_dotprod_f32_aes3(x, x, &ss, size);

    // Normalization factor
    ss = 1.0f / sqrtf(ss / size + 1e-5f);

    // Scale x by ss, then multiply by weight
    dsps_mulc_f32_ae32(x, o, size, ss, 1, 1);       // o = x * ss
    dsps_mul_f32_ae32(o, weight, o, size, 1, 1, 1); // o = o * weight
}
```

The beauty here is that `dsps_dotprod_f32_aes3` computes x dot x (sum of squares) in one SIMD call. Then we use vectorized scalar multiply and element-wise multiply for the normalization.

**Softmax with Numerical Stability:**
```cpp
void softmax(float* x, int size) {
    // Find max (no SIMD equivalent that's faster for small arrays)
    float max_val = x[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (x[i] > max_val) max_val = x[i];
    }

    // Exp and sum (expf() is the bottleneck, can't SIMD this)
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        x[i] = expf(x[i] - max_val);
        sum += x[i];
    }

    // Vectorized division using SIMD multiply by inverse
    float inv_sum = 1.0f / sum;
    dsps_mulc_f32_ae32(x, x, size, inv_sum, 1, 1);
}
```

The `x[i] - max_val` before exp is the numerical stability trick - without it, large values would overflow expf(). The final normalization uses SIMD multiply by reciprocal instead of division (multiply is faster).

**SwiGLU Activation with Unrolling:**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < hidden_dim; i += 4) {
    // Unrolled for better pipelining
    float v0 = s->hb[i], v1 = s->hb[i+1], v2 = s->hb[i+2], v3 = s->hb[i+3];
    // SiLU: x * sigmoid(x)
    v0 *= 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-v0));
    v1 *= 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-v1));
    v2 *= 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-v2));
    v3 *= 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-v3));
    // Gate multiply
    s->hb[i]   = v0 * s->hb2[i];
    s->hb[i+1] = v1 * s->hb2[i+1];
    s->hb[i+2] = v2 * s->hb2[i+2];
    s->hb[i+3] = v3 * s->hb2[i+3];
}
```

This is the SwiGLU activation (SiLU gated linear unit). We can't easily SIMD the sigmoid computation, but we can unroll to help the instruction pipeline overlap the independent calculations.

{{< /sub-section >}}

{{< sub-section title="Three-Phase Training Pipeline" icon="fa-graduation-cap" >}}

Fast inference is useless if the model generates garbage. Our model needed to answer questions about a specific person accurately. This required a careful training pipeline.

**Why Three Phases?**

The intuition comes from transfer learning: teach the model to speak English first, then teach it facts, then teach it the Q&A format. Each phase builds on the previous.

The training notebook lives at `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/workbench/tests/llm_qa_scaled_training/llm_qa_scaled_training.ipynb`.

**Phase 1: TinyStories (Language Structure)**

Dataset: 200,000 children's stories from the TinyStories dataset
Steps: 20,000
Final Loss: 1.5507
Learning Rate: 3e-4

```
"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a big,
red balloon. One day, she went to the park with her mom..."
```

The model learns grammar, sentence structure, coherent narrative flow. It doesn't know anything about our target person yet - it's just learning how language works.

This is crucial. If you skip this phase and go straight to Q&A training, the model memorizes the Q&A pairs but produces incoherent responses when asked novel questions.

**Phase 2: Profile Grounding (Factual Knowledge)**

Dataset: GPT-4 generated prose paragraphs about the person + synthetic Q&A pairs
Steps: 10,000
Final Loss: 0.0133 (very low!)
Learning Rate: 1e-4

Here's where it gets interesting. We use GPT-4 to:
1. Extract prose paragraphs from the profile (50+ different phrasings)
2. Generate 242 synthetic Q&A pairs across 7 categories

Categories: contact info, current work, skills & expertise, work history, education, projects, personal interests.

Sample prose:
```
"Alphons Jaimon embodies the spirit of 'Limitless Ideation,' channeling
his passion from innovation through development to actualization in the
tech realm. Currently serving as a GenAI Engineer at Etherwise since
August 2025, he architects and builds full GenAI applications..."
```

Sample synthetic Q&A:
```
Q: What is Alphons email address
A: chat@ajv009.com

Q: Does Alphons know Python
A: Yes he is proficient in Python
```

The model now knows facts about the person, phrased in many different ways.

**Phase 3: Q&A Memorization (Task-Specific)**

Dataset: 2,008 human-written Q&A pairs, repeated 50 times = 100,400 samples
Steps: 12,000
Final Loss: 0.2378
Learning Rate: 5e-5

This is pure memorization. We have 2,008 specific questions we want the model to answer correctly. By repeating them 50 times and shuffling, we hammer these into the model's weights.

Sample from the dataset:
```csv
1,What is Alphons email address,chat@ajv009.com
2,What is his phone number,+91-8237842347
3,When was Alphons born,August 2001
4,Where does he live,Maharashtra India
5,What languages does Alphons know,English Hindi Marathi Malayalam
```

**Learning Rate Schedule:**

Notice the learning rates decrease: 3e-4 -> 1e-4 -> 5e-5. This is intentional:
- Phase 1: Higher LR for learning general language patterns (we can afford to move weights around)
- Phase 2: Medium LR for adding factual knowledge (don't destroy language skills)
- Phase 3: Low LR for fine-grained memorization (preserve everything, just add Q&A skills)

**Training Results:**

The final 6M model achieves:
- Stories loss: 1.55 (can still write coherent sentences)
- Profile loss: 0.01 (knows the facts cold)
- Q&A loss: 0.24 (good at the Q&A task)

Test inference:
```
Q: What is the name?
A: Alphons Jaimon

Q: What is the email?
A: chat@ajv009.com

Q: Where does Alphons work?
A: Etherwise

Q: Does Alphons know Python?
A: Yes for AI ML work
```

It works! The model gives accurate, concise answers.

{{< /sub-section >}}

{{< sub-section title="Model Scaling Options" icon="fa-expand" >}}

Not everyone needs a 6M parameter model. We trained several sizes:

| Size | Parameters | Int8 Size | Memory Footprint | Speed |
|------|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| 1M | 1,070,000 | 1.07 MB | ~1.5 MB | Fast, but limited |
| 3M | 2,820,000 | 2.82 MB | ~3.5 MB | Good balance |
| 6M | 5,566,176 | 5.98 MB | ~6.5 MB | Best quality |

The architecture scales by adjusting:
- `dim`: Embedding dimension (128 -> 224)
- `hidden_dim`: FFN hidden size (512 -> 896)
- `n_layers`: Transformer layers (4 -> 8)

All models use 8 attention heads with grouped-query attention (4 KV heads) to reduce memory.

**Vocabulary Size**: We train custom SentencePiece tokenizers with 512 or 1024 tokens. Smaller vocab = more tokens per response, but better handling of rare words. 1024 tokens works well for our Q&A domain.

For the badge, we use the 6M model because:
1. It fits in PSRAM (barely - about 6.5MB total with buffers)
2. Quality matters more than speed for Q&A (we only generate once per interaction)
3. The user is waiting anyway while we load the model

{{< /sub-section >}}

{{< sub-section title="SAM TTS Integration" icon="fa-volume-up" >}}

With the LLM generating text responses, we need the badge to actually speak. Enter SAM - Software Automatic Mouth.

SAM is a speech synthesizer from 1982, originally for the Commodore 64. It's wonderfully robotic, requires no neural networks, and fits in about 10KB of code. Perfect for a conference badge.

We use the ESP32-SAM library by pschatzmann. The integration is straightforward but requires a custom I2S output adapter since SAM's default output doesn't match our MAX98357A setup.

From `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/tts/robot_tts.cpp`:

```cpp
class SAMI2SOutput : public SAMOutputBase {
public:
    void open() override {
        i2s_config_t i2s_config = {
            .mode = (i2s_mode_t)(I2S_MODE_MASTER | I2S_MODE_TX),
            .sample_rate = SAMOutputBase::sampleRate(),  // 22050 Hz
            .bits_per_sample = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT,
            .channel_format = I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_RIGHT_LEFT,
            .communication_format = I2S_COMM_FORMAT_STAND_I2S,
            .intr_alloc_flags = ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL1,
            .dma_buf_count = 8,
            .dma_buf_len = 256,
            .use_apll = false,
            .tx_desc_auto_clear = true,
        };

        i2s_driver_install(_port, &i2s_config, 0, NULL);
        i2s_set_pin(_port, &pin_config);
    }

    bool write(byte* buffer, int bytes_count) override {
        size_t bytes_written;
        i2s_write(_port, buffer, bytes_count, &bytes_written, portMAX_DELAY);
        return true;
    }
};
```

SAM outputs at 22050 Hz, which is its native sample rate. We configure I2S to match, avoiding any resampling.

**Voice Configuration:**

SAM has four parameters that shape the voice:
- **Speed**: How fast it speaks (higher = faster)
- **Pitch**: Fundamental frequency (higher = squeakier)
- **Throat**: Resonance cavity size (higher = more hollow)
- **Mouth**: Lip/mouth shape (affects vowel sounds)

For maximum robotic effect:
```cpp
void setVoice(Voice voice) {
    switch (voice) {
        case ROBOT:
            _sam->setSpeed(100);    // Slower for dramatic effect
            _sam->setPitch(50);     // Lower pitch
            _sam->setThroat(200);   // Harsh throat
            _sam->setMouth(200);    // Wide mouth resonance
            break;
    }
}
```

The result is a classic 1980s computer voice - exactly what you want from a conference badge. It's deliberately inhuman, which makes it charming rather than unsettling (looking at you, uncanny valley TTS).

I'll be honest: I didn't spend much time tuning SAM. It's a mature, well-documented library that just works. The whole TTS integration was maybe 2 hours including debugging I2S pin conflicts.

Let's talk numbers.

**Inference Speed:**
- Before (float32, ESP-DSP SIMD): ~0.5 tok/s for 6M model
- After (int8, PIE assembly): ~0.8-1.2 tok/s

That's about 2x improvement. Not the 100x the title promises? Well, the 100x is comparing our PIE assembly to naive scalar C code for int8 dot products. Against already-optimized float SIMD, we see 2x - still significant when you're waiting for the badge to respond.

**Model Load Time:**
- From SD card to PSRAM: ~3-5 seconds
- Includes reading 6MB, dequantizing embeddings, allocating buffers

**Memory Usage (6M model):**
- Raw model weights: ~6 MB
- Token embeddings (dequantized): ~0.4 MB
- KV cache: ~0.5 MB
- Activation buffers: ~0.2 MB
- Total: ~7 MB (fits in 8 MB PSRAM with room to spare)

**Example Outputs:**

```
User: "What is your name?"
Badge: "Alphons Jaimon" (0.8 seconds generation)

User: "What is your email?"
Badge: "chat@ajv009.com" (0.6 seconds)

User: "Tell me about your work"
Badge: "GenAI Engineer at Etherwise building AI applications" (1.8 seconds)
```

The responses are concise because we trained on short answers. For a conference badge, this is ideal - you want quick responses, not essays.

This was the most technically challenging part of the badge project. Some hard-won lessons:

**1. Assembly is hard but worth it for hot loops**

I went through maybe 15 iterations of the PIE assembly before it worked correctly. Register clobbering, alignment issues, accumulator overflow - every bug was subtle and hard to diagnose.

But the payoff is real. For the inner loop of matmul (which we execute millions of times per token), 2x speedup is huge. Don't optimize everything with assembly - just the hot paths.

**2. Quantization quality depends on training data**

We initially tried to take a pre-trained model and quantize it. The results were bad - the model would hallucinate, forget facts, and generally misbehave.

Training from scratch with quantization-aware training would be better, but we compromised: train in float32, then quantize carefully. The three-phase approach helps because each phase can recover from any drift introduced by quantization.

**3. Three-phase training is more stable than end-to-end**

Our first approach was to train on all data mixed together. The model would learn Q&A format but forget how to write coherent sentences. Or it would write beautifully but not answer questions accurately.

Phased training with decreasing learning rates is slower but much more predictable. Each phase has clear success criteria (loss thresholds), and you can checkpoint between phases for recovery.

**4. Memory alignment is not optional**

The ESP32-S3 PIE instructions REQUIRE 16-byte aligned pointers. The code will crash with no helpful error message if you pass unaligned pointers.

Always use `heap_caps_aligned_alloc(16, size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)` for anything that touches PIE. Don't trust regular malloc, even if the addresses happen to be aligned on your test runs.

**5. Claude Code is genuinely helpful for assembly**

I used Claude extensively for this work. It helped me understand PIE instruction semantics, suggested the loopnez zero-overhead loop, and caught several register allocation bugs. I verified everything on hardware, but having an AI pair programmer for assembly is legitimately useful.

With LLM inference and TTS working, the badge can now:
1. Detect a wake word (Blog 3/4)
2. Record audio and compute embeddings
3. Search for matching intents
4. Generate a response with the LLM
5. Speak the response with SAM

The next post (Blog 6) will cover the integration of all these components and the final polish - sleep modes, error handling, and the complete user experience.

The code for this post lives primarily in:
- `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/ml/llm_core.cpp` - PIE assembly and quantization
- `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/ml/llm_inference.cpp` - Token generation loop
- `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/ml/sampler.cpp` - Top-p nucleus sampling
- `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/local_llm_badge/src/tts/robot_tts.cpp` - SAM integration
- `/home/alphons/project/OAISYS25/badge/workbench/tests/llm_qa_scaled_training/` - Training pipeline

If you're building something similar and get stuck on PIE assembly, feel free to reach out. It's a niche topic and I'm happy to help.

Until next time - keep building weird things.
